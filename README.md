# YXK_UEAnimPractice
## Features
* UE4 Animation - This is a sample repository for UE4 animation to demonstrate UE4 animation capabilities.
* By dividing complex functions into independent animation blueprints and combining independent scenes, 
* learners can flexibly learn and use the required functions.The current engine version is 4.24, VS 2017.
* If you have any questions or Suggestions, please contact me.
